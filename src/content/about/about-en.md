Hi! Dear friend, welcome to my little corner.

I’m Flynn Cao. I used to be a frontend/fullstack developer and am now a student researching ASR and LLMs.

This blog is where I share tech insights and practice writing. Occasionally, I also post personal reflections or travel notes. Beyond open-source projects, you’ll find my experiments with productivity tools and my journey learning languages (Chinese: Native; English, IELTS 7 in 2020; Japanese: JLPT N2 in 2024).

Interests: Outside of CS domain, I mainly read contemporary literature from China, Japan, and Europe, and occasionally explore productivity, psychology, and philosophy. I’m also a casual anime fan, a retired gamer, and when I am hanging out, it’s usually for hiking or *City Walk*, I’m not much a fan of a photography.

Whether you’re a new visitor or an old friend, thank you for stopping by, and I appreciate that you enjoy my writing!
